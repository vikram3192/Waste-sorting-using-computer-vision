Waste Sorting Using Computer Vision

Overview

This project focuses on utilizing computer vision techniques to create an automated waste sorting system. By analyzing images of waste materials, the system classifies them into categories such as plastic, paper, metal, and organic waste. This helps in efficient waste management and contributes to a sustainable environment.


Features

Real-time Waste Detection: Quickly classifies waste materials using a camera.

Multiple Categories: Supports sorting into multiple waste categories.

Machine Learning Integration: Uses trained models for accurate classification.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple interface for deployment in various environments.

Scalable: Can be adapted for industrial or household use.


Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Machine Learning Framework: TensorFlow / PyTorch

Computer Vision: OpenCV

Dataset: Custom waste images or publicly available datasets like TrashNet.

Deployment Tools: Flask, Streamlit, or other web-based solutions.


Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled images of different types of waste. The dataset includes:

Plastic: Bottles, bags, etc.

Paper: Newspapers, cardboard, etc.

Metal: Cans, tins, etc.

Organic Waste: Food scraps, plant material, etc.


Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/username/waste-sorting


2. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the application:

python app.py



Usage

1. Capture an image or upload a waste image.


2. The system processes the image and classifies it into the appropriate category.


3. The output is displayed on the interface or stored in the database for further processing.



Model Training

1. Preprocess the dataset (resizing, augmentation, etc.).


2. Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the dataset.


3. Save the trained model for deployment.



Results

Accuracy: 76% on the test dataset.




Future Improvements

Expanding the dataset for better generalization.

Adding support for more waste categories.

Integrating robotics for automatic waste handling.
